**Time Unit Converter**
This is a basic Python program that converts a given time value into various other time units.

**How It Works**
When you run the script, it will prompt you to choose the base unit for your time calculation (e.g., hours, minutes, seconds, days, or years). After you make your selection, you'll enter the numerical value for that unit. The program will then output the equivalent values in all the other supported time units.

**Usage**
Run the script: Execute the Python file (e.g., python your_script_name.py from your terminal).
Choose a base unit: You'll see a list of options. Enter the corresponding number (1-5) for the unit you want to convert from.
Enter the value: Input the numerical value for your chosen base unit.
View results: The program will display the converted values in hours, minutes, seconds, days, and years.
**Example**
Let's say you choose to convert from hours and enter the value 24:

choose the thing on which bases you want calculate the time
 1. hour
 2. minute
 3. seconds
 4. days
 5. years
Enter your Choice 1
Enter hours: 24
HOURS = 24
MINUTES = 1440
SECONDS = 86400
DAYS = 1
YEARS = 0
